* Introduction

  We will import a Hartree-Fock wavefunction for the formaldehyde
  (H_{2}CO) molecule from a TREXIO file into Quantum Package (QP), and
  run a two-state CIPSI calculation with these orbitals. The
  wavefunctions for the 2 states will be stored in the TREXIO file,
  and we will run wave function optimization in CHAMP, followed by a
  Diffusion Monte Carlo calculation.

  #+begin_tip
  The theoretical best estimate of the excitation energy (complete basis set
  extrapolation from coupled cluster calculations) is 3.97 eV.
  #+end_tip

* CIPSI 2-state calculations

  You can import the single-determinant wave function from the
  provided [[https://github.com/TREX-CoE/school-ncc-2023/raw/master/docs/TrexioFiles/COH2.trexio][TREXIO file COH2.trexio] as:

  #+begin_src bash
wget https://github.com/TREX-CoE/school-ncc-2023/raw/master/docs/TrexioFiles/COH2.trexio
qp_import_trexio.py COH2.trexio -o COH2
qp set_file COH2
  #+end_src

  Specify that you want to run a two-state calculation:

  #+begin_src bash
qp set determinants n_states 2
  #+end_src

  Tell QP to stop when the number of determinants is larger than 2000

  #+begin_src bash
qp set determinants n_det_max 2000
  #+end_src

  and run the CIPSI in the Full-CI space:

  #+begin_src bash
qp_srun fci COH2 | tee COH2.fci.out
  #+end_src

  #+begin_note
  The extrapolated excitation energy is around 8 eV and we expect 4 ev, so
  we did not catch the correct state.  This is because the
  orbitals in the TREXIO file are symmetry adapted, so it is
  impossible to make a determinant from another symmetry enter in the
  determinant space.

  To obtain a solution from another symmetry, we need to put at least
  one determinant of each symmetry.

  #+end_note

  #+begin_tip
  The simplest practical solution is to first perform a CIS, and then
  continue with a CIPSI in the FCI space.
  #+end_tip

  By default, at every iteration QP tries to double the size of the wave function.
  In QMC, we will use a small number of determinants, so we should tell QP to
  add less determinants at each iteration to have a finer selection.

  #+begin_src bash
qp set determinants selection_factor 0.5
  #+end_src

  #+begin_src bash
qp_srun cis COH2 | tee COH2.cis.out
qp set determinants read_wf true
qp_srun fci COH2 | tee COH2.fci.out
  #+end_src

  =read_wf = true= specifies that the wave function stored in the
  EZFIO database should be used as a starting point for the the CI calculation.

  Now, we have obtained a more reasonable excitation energy, around 4
  eV. We are now ready to export the data for CHAMP.

* Export wave functions to CHAMP

  The excited states are of different symmetries, so we will generate
  two different setups in CHAMP, one for each state. To do that, we will
  save two different files, one for each state, and containing only
  the non-zero determinants.

  First, copy the =COH2= directory into =COH2_GS= and =COH2_ES=, one
  directory for each state:

  #+begin_src bash
cp -r COH2 COH2_GS
cp -r COH2 COH2_ES
  #+end_src

  Then, we will use =qp_edit= to extract one state in each EZFIO
  directory:

  #+begin_src bash
qp set_file COH2_GS
qp edit --state=1

qp set_file COH2_ES
qp edit --state=2
  #+end_src

  The states have been extracted, but the EZFIO databases still
  contain the determinants with almost zero coefficients. We can remove them
  by running

  #+begin_src bash
qp set_file COH2_GS
qp run truncate_wf
  #+end_src

  This last program is interactive and asks for the minimum weight of
  the kept configurations. Answer =1.d-10= to this question.

  Similarly, remove the negligible determinants from the excited
  state:

  #+begin_src bash
qp set_file COH2_ES
qp run truncate_wf
  #+end_src

  We can now export the wave functions in two different TREXIO
  files. To do that, for each state we copy the initial TREXIO file
  and add the determinants information:

  #+begin_src bash
cp COH2.trexio COH2_GS.trexio
qp set_file COH2_GS
qp set trexio trexio_file  COH2_GS.trexio
qp_srun export_trexio COH2_GS
  #+end_src

  #+begin_src bash
cp COH2.trexio COH2_ES.trexio
qp set_file COH2_ES
qp set trexio trexio_file  COH2_ES.trexio
qp_srun export_trexio COH2_ES
  #+end_src

  Now, we are ready to run the QMC calculations for each state.


* QMC wave function optimizations

  In this section, we will optimize a Jastrow factor for each state, and
  we will the re-optimize the CI coefficients in the presence of the Jastrow.
  The setup of the CHAMP files is similar to what we have done in
  [[./04-QP_CHAMP.org][section 4]].

  #+begin_warning
  Here, we have 12 electrons, 6 up and 6 down.
  #+end_warning

** Optimization of the ground state

  Create a new directory, and copy the =COH2_GS.trexio= TREXIO file inside it.
  Convert the TREXIO file into CHAMP files:

  #+begin_src bash
python3 /project/project_465000321/champ/tools/trex_tools/trex2champ.py \
                        --trex          "COH2_GS.trexio" \
                        --motype        "Canonical" \
                        --backend       "HDF5" \
                        --basis_prefix  "BFD-aug-cc-pVDZ" \
                        --lcao \
                        --geom \
                        --basis \
                        --ecp \
                        --sym \
                        --det
  #+end_src

  H_{2}CO has three different atom types, so the Jastrow factor file
  will be slightly different from the file for water with one extra
  line for $a$ parameters. You can start by creating a file
  called =jastrow.start=:

  #+begin_example
jastrow_parameter   1
  5  5  0           norda,nordb,nordc
   0.60000000   0.00000000     scalek,a21
   0.00000000   0.00000000  0. 0. 0. 0. (a(iparmj),iparmj=1,nparma) ! e-n C
   0.00000000   0.00000000  0. 0. 0. 0. (a(iparmj),iparmj=1,nparma) ! e-n O
   0.00000000   0.00000000  0. 0. 0. 0. (a(iparmj),iparmj=1,nparma) ! e-n H
   0.50000000   1.00000000  0. 0. 0. 0. (b(iparmj),iparmj=1,nparmb)
 (c(iparmj),iparmj=1,nparmc) ! e-e-n C
 (c(iparmj),iparmj=1,nparmc) ! e-e-n O
 (c(iparmj),iparmj=1,nparmc) ! e-e-n H
end
  #+end_example

  Start by optimizing the Jastrow factor and perform a "quick"
  optimization.  The following champ input file (=vmc_quick.inp=)
  contains the parameters for such a "quick" optimization.

#+begin_example
%module optwf
    ioptwf        1
    ioptci        0
    ioptjas       1
    ioptorb       0
    method        'sr_n'

    ncore         0
    nextorb       600
    nblk_max      5000

    nopt_iter     10
    sr_tau        0.05
    sr_eps        0.01
    sr_adiag      0.01
%endmodule


%module blocking_vmc
    vmc_nstep     20
    vmc_nblk      20
    vmc_nblkeq    1
    vmc_nconf_new 0
%endmodule
  #+end_example

  Move the =jastrow_optimal.1.iter10= file to =jastrow_optimal.rough_GS= and
  load this optimized Jastrow factor. You can now optimize also the CI
  coefficients together with the Jastrow factor by setting:

#+begin_example
    ioptci        1
#+end_example

  Use some more Monte Carlo steps to perform a more strict optimization.

#+begin_example
%module blocking_vmc
    vmc_nstep     20
    vmc_nblk      500
    vmc_nblkeq    1
    vmc_nconf_new 0
%endmodule
#+end_example

   In your directory, you will now have =jastrow_optimal.1.iterX= and
   =det_optimal.1.iterX= files.

   Set up a DMC calculation where you use the optimal Jastrow and
   CI coefficients. Adjust the ~etrial~ to be a bit below the VMC energy.
   Recall that you will have to generate the =mc_configs= file.

  #+begin_tip
   Note: You could have also optimized the orbitals but we did not
   do it here to keep the calculations short. If you are setting
   ~optorb=1~, load also the symmetry file.

#+begin_example
load champ_v2_COH2_GS_symmetry.sym
#+end_example

  #+end_tip

** Optimization of the excited state

  Create a new directory, and copy the =COH2_ES.trexio= TREXIO file inside it.
  Apply the same procedure as for the ground state.

  Repeat what you have done for the ground state. Start to perform
  a quick optimization of the Jastrow factor but do not start from
  zero's: start from the Jastrow factor you have for the ground
  state, namely, =jastrow_optimal.rough_GS=.

  Do all step until when you obtain the DMC energy.

  Compute the VMC and DMC excitation energies. Recall that if your
  energies are
  \[
  E_{\rm GS}+\delta E_{\rm GS}  \text{ and } E_{\rm ES}+\delta E_{\rm ES},
  \]
  where $\delta E$ is the statistical error,
  the error on $\Delta E= E_{\rm ES}-E_{\rm GS}$
  is given by
  \[
  \sqrt{\delta E_{\text{GS}}^2+\delta E_{\text{ES}}^2}.
  \]
